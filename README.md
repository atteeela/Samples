## Calling These Services

All of these services are all live and running under the `stackhut` namespace, i.e. `stackhut/servicename`, and can be called and tried out.
You can call them using any of the client libraries or `curl` as described in the [StackHut documentation](http://stackhut.readthedocs.org/).

Happy hacking! :)
